# SUDOKU App built using Flutter

This is my first debut in app development. I learnt flutter on londonAppBrewery. Angela Yu is a great tutor. Looking forward to do more courses taught by her.

Coming to this app, This is a clean sudoku app with cool design and i must admit that this had a naive algorithm for sudoku generation and solver. I haven't stressed on logic. I focussed on layout and app design and I succeded. 

Below are the screenshots.
